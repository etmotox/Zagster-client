# Total amount of Zagster bike share rides from 2016-2018 and also the amount of monthly rides in 2017.
## Gathered Zagster bike share data from the city of Bend, Oregon.
* Used SQL, Python, npm, to load data into heroku database.
* Pulled data from relational database and used JavaScript, jQuery and JSON to get data and display on graph.
* I originally wanted to have the total amount of rides on one graph. The graph would be divided by year and inside each year would be each month. You would be able to hover over a year or month and retrieve the total rides for the item you were hovering over. I will get better at JavaScript and learn how to do this.
